def commandprompt(): #We used "Def" as the function from Java, and commandprompt is our function name
  print("whatever") #This will print after it passes the function, Now unlike Lua we dont use a end function instead we used:
  return #This would return the prompt or:
  break #This would break the code, Stopping it from going farther than this, used for if-then statement to stop it
